            <p>Mythology is a collection of legends, myths, and tales from a certain culture. Generally, these myths are
                deeply
                intertwined with religion and are used to study the culture of ancient socieities.
                <br>
                While there are tons of different mythos thorughout history, Roman and Greek mythology are most known,
                followed
                by Norse Mythology.

            <p>Greek mythology is one of the older mythos in ancient history. Egyptian mythology is older, but the Greek
                mythos
                relates to Western society in a much more prominent way.

            <h3 class="header">Interested in Roman Mythology?</h3>
            <p>Roman mythology is probably the most popular mythos in the modern day. The Romans adapted the Greek
                mythos
                and
                added their rich culture, art, and language, creating a mythos which is beautiful in its descriptions
                and
                significant in its revelations.

            <h3 class="header">Interested in Norse Mythology?</h3>
            <p>Norse mythology, while not as well known, is vastly different from the Roman and Greek mythos. With a
                more
                brutal
                culture and a heavier focus on war, Norse mythos delves into the glories and consequences of battle.
