            <p>Roman mythology was the Latin adaptation of Greek mythology. Rather than starting as oral tradition, much
                of
                Roman mythology began as works of literature.
                These works described in-depth stories of each and every god and goddess.

            <h3 class="header">Legacy</h3>
            <p>Roman mythology not only holds a large legacy on modern peoples, but was extremely important in the
                development and expansion of Rome itself.
                Roman mythos often inspired fantastical buildings and magnificent feats of art. Today, its legacy lives
                on
                in the names of planets.
