        <h3 class="header">Origins</h3>
        <p>Roman mythology was the Latin adaptation of Greek mythology. Rather than starting as oral tradition, much of Roman mythology began as works of literature.
            These works described in-depth stories of each and every god and goddess.

        <h3 class="header">Legacy</h3>
        <p>Roman mythology not only holds a large legacy on modern peoples, but was extremely important in the development and expansion of Rome itself.
            Roman mythos often inspired fantastical buildings and magnificent feats of art. Today, its legacy lives on in the names of planets.
