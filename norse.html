            <p>Norse mythology was the Scandinavian religion before and during the Christianization of Scandinavia.
                Most Norse mythology started with oral tradition, and written records of the subject are hard to find.
                These traditions described stories oriented around warring and honor.

            <h3 class="header">Legacy</h3>
            <p>Norse mythology does not hold a great legacy on modern peoples, but it was of great importance to the
                Viking era - namely its conquests.
                Norse mythos encouraged death through battle and honorable conquest at all costs.
                Today, its legacy lives on in the modern world's fascination with its afterlife, Valhalla.
