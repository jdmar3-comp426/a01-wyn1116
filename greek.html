            <p>Greek mythology has complicated origins. For the most part, Greek mythology started from oral traditions
                during
                the bronze age.
                These traditions eventually evolved into written text throughout the archaic and classical periods.

            <h3 class="header">Legacy</h3>
            <p>The legacy of the Greek mythos is most celebrated with Homer's works - the Illiad and the Odyssey. These
                tales of
                the Trojan Wars cemented
                Greek culture into the minds of modern people as an illustrious society filled with intense and
                impossible
                feats
                of success.
