        <h3 class="header">Legacy</h3>
        <p>The legacy of the Greek mythos is most celebrated with Homer's works - the Illiad and the Odyssey. These tales of the Trojan Wars cemented
            Greek culture into the minds of modern people as an illustrious society filled with intense and impossible feats of success.
